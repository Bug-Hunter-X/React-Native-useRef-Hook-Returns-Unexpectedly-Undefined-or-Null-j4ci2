# React Native useRef Hook Unexpectedly Undefined or Null

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where the `useRef` hook returns `undefined` or `null` unexpectedly. The bug and a solution are provided to illustrate the problem and how to resolve it.

**Bug:** The main issue lies in attempting to access the ref before the component's render cycle has completed or during asynchronous operations.

**Solution:** The solution shows how to correctly handle the asynchronous nature of React Native updates by using the `useEffect` hook and ensuring the ref is accessed only after the component has mounted and the necessary elements have been rendered.
